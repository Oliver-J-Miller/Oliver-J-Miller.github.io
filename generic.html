									<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
									<p>I'm a second year game software engineering at Bournemouth University working towards my bachelors(hon).</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Ollie for HaSO.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am 20 years old and have had a passion for games for as long as I can remember. Originating from my childhood of playing on consoles like the n64, ps2 and Wii. I found it facinating how a team of individuals could create the massive worlds full of life and imagination. 
									My first games were Spyro and The Legends of Zelda which solidified my love for RPGs and the genres as a whole. leading me on to playing the Fable series and Skyrim which grew my passion. When I went into secondary I was introduced to the wonderful world of D&D as 5th edition had just come out, this started the early parts of my world building and creativity for games.
									Today I run the Roleplay Soceity at Bournemouth University, not only as their Health and Safety Officer but also as their lead 5e content creator, helping returning and new individuals to the world of D&D.  
								</p>
								<p>It is a collection of this experiences that sparked my interest in the engineering and programming side of Game Development. I have been artistically talented or shown much promise in the design department, only being able to produce decent designs with heavy help from software like Illustator, but I've always been rather good with puzzles. 
									When I saw the mechanical and engineering side of games, it was so interesting. Code to me is like working out a picture puzzle but you're making the shapes themselves, then fitting them together. I was always a fan of the Professor Layton games and how they managed to make so many different puzzles designs but they always stayed in theme and mechanically worked beautifully.
									I try and recreate this in my programming by making things efficient but also interesting as I tend to be quite innovative in the way I solve issues in my algorithms.
								</p>
								<p>Getting into University was a dream come true, finally getting to learn exactly what makes a game and the proper way to program it. I have loved every moment so far and am looking forward to the rest of the projects that I will be making in either game jams or to test my recently learned knowledge on a unit.
									Being able to get a taster of what it is like in the industry itself however, will be more valuable then I can even describe, learning how to operate a portion of the game as part of a team, being able to see how the companies itself works. Most importantly, I want to see what really makes a Game Company AAA.
